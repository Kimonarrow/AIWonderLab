# AiWonderLAB

"We don't know where we're going and that's Wonderful."

*AiWonderLAB is a space to explore, play, and discover, what happens when AI meets human playfulness.*

# How We Work

"Exploring the unknown is much more fun than following the rules."

1. **Curiosity**
   - We start with a thought, problem, or an inspiration to tackle.

2. **Play**
   - We willingly play with any game/scenario and actively test, tweak, fail, retry, on all action that need to evolve on.

3. **Result**
   - Something happens - a discovery, an insight, a manifestation, or an unexpected result. We add it up and move forward.
